# Regression to the Mean of Extreme Geomagnetic Storms

This repository contains code that is associated with the paper titled "Regression to the Mean of Extreme Geomagnetic Storms"

Three of the main codes used to calculate all the results in the paper are available as .html files, so that the logic and results can be followed by anyone without having to use MATLAB or Python.

## Code used for the different results presented in the paper

1. [Code 1](Code1_Monte_Carlo_Simulation_of_Solar_Wind_Uncertainty.html)


The Data files used by the code are stored in a zenodo repository. 

If you wish to run the MATLAB and Python Code,

1. Download Data.zip from zenodo-link and unzip into your local machine, and point MATLAB Code 1 variable DataDir to the Data folder. Example DataDir = 'C:\Users\username\Documents\GitHub\polar-cap-saturation\Data\';
2. Download Datasets.zip from zenodo-link and unzip into your local machine within the local copy of this GitHub or Git folder. The python notebook Code3_Calculating_magnitude_uncertainty.ipynb uses this folder for its input data. So the code should be able to access this folder as './Datasets/'.
